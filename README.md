# Cefet-games-classes

Each repository was a class code , made to learn/develop and showcase a certain knowledge.

some are not commented/documented because at the time i didn't tough i would give value over it.

anyway i compiled'em over a single file to better showcase repositories, and have a bunch of repos no one used.
